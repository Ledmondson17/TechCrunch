## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

Used HTML and CSS to make a replica Tech Crunch web page.

## Optimizations
I came back and tweaked this page after I had discovered a breakthrough with CSS and spacing.

## Lessons Learned:

This project furthered my understanding of CSS and spacing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
